to-do list
- what if we kill all enemies early? time should speed up
- turn off rb collisions between current stage and ghosts, BUT not for bullets or weapons
- are bullets and weapons 0.5x speed?
- weird thing with NextLevel() still being ghost called somewhere in GameManager script when dying, causing double music to play
- figure out why it doesn't auto-full screen
- bullets and lasers and such should be 0.5 opacity
- remove healthbar for player since they're invincible
- fix movement anims

add
