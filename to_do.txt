to-do list
- what if we kill all enemies early? time should speed up
- are bullets and weapons 0.5x speed?
- figure out why it doesn't auto-full screen
- weird bug where player ghost turns blue if hit by enemy (will re-arise if player is no longer invincible)
- make webgl build and share to Jacob
- settings gui doesn't persist between game going back to main menu or tutorial going back to main menu, causing a crash when player replays game multiple times
- settings in tutorial does not currently overlap tutorial instructions
- in the future, find a better way to persist settings between scenes (look it up) - probably just repopulate based on stored data tbh

add

AFTERWARDS
