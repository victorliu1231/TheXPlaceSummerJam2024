# TheXPlaceSummerJam2024
## Description
A minute can last seconds hereâ€¦ or an eternity. It all depends on how well you can traverse time. Some friends will keep you occupied for a while. Careful: You might start seeing ghosts.  

Stuck in an unstable realm, players must battle ever-growing hordes of enemies with weapons found across the map to survive. They can also travel through time. This strategy game allows players to aid their future self and subsequently receive aid from their past self. Survival hinges on their ability to traverse through the fourth dimension. Echoes of Eternity is an endless mode arcade-style game.  

This game was developed by Amoriem Labs. We are a club of college students who develop games in our spare time.
